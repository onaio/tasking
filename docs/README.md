Ona Tasking provides tasking functionality via:

* [Abstract model classes]() : These are classes that can be imported and extended by your own project. The classes provided the most basic requirements of a task. _You can read more about Django abstract base classes [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/#abstract-base-classes)._

* [Concrete model classes](): These are classes that extend our base classes. They can be used out of the box if your project does not require any modification of the base model classes.

* [APIs](): --- Brief Detail about our APIs ---

* [Helper Functions](): --- Brief Detail about our Helper Functions ---
